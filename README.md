# Signature Verification Deep Learning Project

This project aims to develop a signature verification tool using deep learning techniques. The primary objective is to determine the authenticity of signatures by comparing them to reference signatures. This tool can be particularly useful in banks for verifying signatures on cheques or demand drafts.

## Project Overview

The signature verification deep learning project utilizes the concept of a multilayered perceptron, a type of artificial neural network. By leveraging this architecture, the model can learn the patterns and features necessary for accurate signature verification.

## Features

The main features of this signature verification tool are as follows:

- **Signature Similarity Score**: The model generates a similarity score indicating how closely the provided signature matches the original signature. This score serves as a measure of authenticity.

- **Banking Applications**: This tool is designed to be applicable in the banking sector, specifically for verifying signatures on cheques or demand drafts. By automating the verification process, it can enhance security and streamline operations.

## Technologies Used

The signature verification deep learning project utilizes the following technologies:

- **Python**: The project is implemented using Python programming language, which is widely used in machine learning and deep learning applications.

- **Flask**: Flask, a lightweight web framework, is employed to develop a user-friendly interface for interacting with the signature verification tool.

- **Open-source Libraries**: The model is built upon various open-source libraries and frameworks that provide essential functionalities for deep learning, such as TensorFlow, Keras, and scikit-learn.

## Usage

Upon accessing the signature verification tool through a web browser, follow these steps:

1. Upload an image of the signature you want to verify.

2. The model will process the image and generate a signature similarity score.

3. The similarity score will be displayed, indicating the level of similarity between the provided signature and the reference signature.

4. Based on the similarity score, you can make an informed decision about the authenticity of the signature.
